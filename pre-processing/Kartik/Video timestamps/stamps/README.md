Format of both start and end is:
"(hh, mm, ss)"

Each csv file is name after the corresponding video name

the last end is the start by the participant

the synced_times_all.csv's offset time column gives the real time at which the video starts for that participant.

Note: 
*Participant 16 actually started at 11am but in 'time data- Time sheet sorted.csv' says its starting at 1pm. Still the visual starting point is taken.
*Similarly for participant 26. There's difference in start in csv file and in video. But visual start is taken.
